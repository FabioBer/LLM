In this Figure,  value -1 indicates null or lack of existing candidates on  that five places. First element leader, that is the most valuable node, is elected Figure 5. Leader election process in CBLEEA {5} The working of the algorithm is shown in Figures 6  and 7.

            "In a distributed system, the communication amongst the components is not only limited, but also asynchronous. As a result, there is no global point of coordination. In such a setup, who will be the master, who will be the slave, or who will be the leader? A leader is expected to bring all the slaves together under it.\n",
            "There are various leader election algorithms like singly-probetical single leader election, k-approval, etc. \n",
            "For a leader election to be successful, it is very important to ensure that only one leader can claim the election, and that leader can claim the election only if all the slaves accept it.\n",

In such a setup, there is a possibility that a different leader may be able to be formed by a component which has faster communication capabilities, or which is a component which is more readily available to the others.\n",
            "    - Processing Power: the components have limited processing power, or the processing power is shared amongst the components. In such a setup, it becomes difficult to ensure that a new leader can be formed.\n",
