        "email = \"\"\"it isn't hard at all to create your own modified version of the redhat distro. There's even a tarball[1] with this specifically in mind. The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball.Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO.It *is* a good idea though. I've been wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all).I don't discount any other work like for example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro. Anyone?Regards, Shane.-----Original Message----- From: wintermute [mailto:cout@eircom.net] Sent: 13 August 2002 00:48 To: ilug@linux.ie Subject: Re: [ILUG] SUSE 8 disks?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right.Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places such a suggestion would stumble. Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.Just a pseudo random thought. I'm only laughing on the outside My smile is just skin deep If you could see inside I'm really crying You might join me for a weep. <>-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.
