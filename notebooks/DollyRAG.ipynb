These components communicate over networks with the help of protocols and run in different locations, called nodes. If each component can assume that it can communicate with other components and perform some actions only if it is able to contact other components, there will be chaos. In order to maintain the order, it is important for some entity to be the leader. A leader can communicate with other leaders and the rest of the components. It can listen to and publish messages to the network. This helps other components to converge on a common state, without needing to directly communicate with each other. The process of election is important in distributed systems.\n"

            "    [' Bully algorithm was ﬁrst presented by Garcia Molina in 1982. The Bully algorithm in distributed computing system is used for dynamically electing a leader by using the process ID number. The process with the highest process ID number is elected as the leader process 1. Assumptions (i) Each process has a unique and not null number to distinguish them and each process knows other process number (ii) Processes dont know which ones are currently up and down (iii) The entire system is synchronous. Timeouts are used for deciding process failure (iv) Processes can crash even during execution of algorithm (v) Message delivery between processes is reliable and time bound 2. Aim: The aim of election Algorithm execution is selecting one process as leader (Coordinator) that all processes agree with it. In other words, electing a process with the highest priority or highest ID number as a leader or coordinator', ' Result of this analysis clearly shows that modiﬁed algorithm is better than bully algorithm with fewer message passing and the fewer stages REFERENCES 1.
